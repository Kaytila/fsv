# About

This is the story of the difficult journey of a family fleeing from their beautiful, loved land. Stories like this lie at the roots of many families in Colombia.

Two generations ago, thousands of people were forced to leave their homes in the countryside and seek the relative safety of the cities, as a result of what would later be known as "La Violencia", a time when hatred between followers of the opposite political parties was so high that innocent people were tortured and killed for mere suspicions, or if lucky; forced to leave their homes.
